**DeepTrace** is a powerful CLI tool and Python library designed to analyze and identify performance bottlenecks in automated test execution logs. It supports multiple formats including Playwright, Selenium, Allure, HAR files, and generic JSON logs.

## What Problems Does DeepTrace Solve?

### Current Challenges:
- **Slow Test Suites**: Identifying which specific steps are causing pipeline delays
- **Performance Regressions**: Detecting when tests become slower between releases  
- **Log Analysis Overhead**: Manual analysis of large test execution logs is time-consuming
- **Multi-Format Support**: Different testing tools generate different log formats
- **CI/CD Optimization**: Need for automated performance monitoring in pipelines

### DeepTrace Solutions:
- **Instant Performance Analysis**: Quickly pinpoint the slowest operations in your test logs
- **Multi-Format Support**: Works with Playwright, Selenium, Allure, HAR, and JSON logs out of the box
- **Regression Detection**: Compare test runs to identify performance degradations
- **Automated Reporting**: Generate markdown reports for CI artifacts and documentation
- **Rich Visual Output**: Beautiful console output with color coding and progress indicators

## Key Features

| âœ” | What it does                                                                                           |
|---|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| âœ… | **Auto-detects log format** â€“ just pass a file or directory, no `--format` flag needed                |
| âœ… | **Multiple format support** â€“ Playwright, Selenium, Allure, HAR, and generic JSON                     |
| âœ… | **Performance threshold filtering** â€“ show only steps slower than specified duration                    |
| âœ… | **Top-N analysis** â€“ display the slowest N operations for quick identification                         |
| âœ… | **Rich console output** â€“ color-coded, formatted display with ASCII-safe fallback                     |
| âœ… | **Markdown report generation** â€“ perfect for CI artifacts and documentation                            |
| âœ… | **A/B comparison mode** â€“ compare two test runs to spot performance regressions                       |
| âœ… | **Zero-config operation** â€“ works out of the box with sensible defaults                               |
| âœ… | **Extensible parser API** â€“ easily add support for new log formats                                    |
